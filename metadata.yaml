description: 'First published in 1904, ""A Kidnapped Santa Claus"" by L. Frank Baum,
  the author of The Wizard of Oz, describes the action of some uncommon events in
  the land of Santa. Not far from the Laughing Valley where Santa and all his magical
  helpers live, and beyond the Forest of Burzee, there stands a huge mountain that
  contains the Cave of Demons. Each demon has a specialty: Selfishness, Envy, Hatred,
  Malice, and Repentance. Because the promise of Santa puts all girls and boys on
  their best behavior, the demons have hardly any visitors to their caves. In order
  to remedy their dism.'
